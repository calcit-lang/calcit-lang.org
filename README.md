Phlox Calcit Workflow
----

> for phlox.calcit .

### Usages

Install [calcit-runner](https://github.com/Cirru/calcit-runner.nim) to run demo:
```bash
cr
```

Notice that the loaded modules comes from [phlox.calcit](https://github.com/Quamolit/phlox.calcit).

### Difference from `phlox-workflow`.

Originally Phlox as implemented based on ClojureScript and PIXI.js . However current implementation with Nim and Cario costs less memory, although with far fewer features. I prefer using Nim's version since it's controlled by Cirru ecosystem.
